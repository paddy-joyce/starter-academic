Anthropogenic driven climate change is the largest problem faced by the natural world. In the oceans, changes are occurring in the form of acidification, warming (both long term and extreme short term events), and changes in hydrodynamic conditions. Identifying how such environmental change alters ecophysiological processes and species interactions provides the basis for the majority of my work, including my other key research themes.
