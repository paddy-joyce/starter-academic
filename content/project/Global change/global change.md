Anthropogenic driven climate change is the largest problem faced by the natural world. In the oceans, changes are occurring in the form of acidification, warming (both long term and extreme short term events, more recently dubbed 'marine heatwaves'), and changes in hydrodynamic conditions. Such changes to the abiotic environment are an underlying theme to the other projects here - i.e. I aim to investigate themes of global abiotic change and how they can influence invasive species success and ecological impacts, as well as identifying how important bivalve species respond to such changes.
