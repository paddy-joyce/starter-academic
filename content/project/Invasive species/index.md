Damaging invasive species are one of the largest drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, however, their impacts are often overlooked in favour of other, more socially contagious topics such as plastic waste. Owing to their capacity to drive changes in biodiversity and disrupt ecosystems, improving our abilities to understand and predict the impacts of invasive species is important. This on-going work uses experimental approaches to understand why invasive species succeed in new ecosystems, and to quantify the ecological impacts of damaging invaders.
