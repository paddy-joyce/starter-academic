abstract: "The Hong Kong oyster Magallana hongkongensis, previously known as Crassostrea hongkongensis, is a true oyster species native to the estuarine-coast of the Pearl River Delta in southern China. The species—with scientific, ecological, cultural, and nutritional importance—has been farmed for hundreds of years. However, there is only limited information on its genetics, stress adaptation mechanisms, and gut microbiota, restricting the sustainable production and use of oyster resources. Here, we present population structure analysis on M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, as well as transcriptome analysis on heat shock responses and the gut microbiota profile of M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including those on the homeobox genes and heat shock protein genes, were revealed by the whole genome resequencing. Transcriptomes of oysters incubated at 25 °C and 32 °C for 24 h were sequenced which revealed the heat-induced regulation of heat shock protein pathway genes. Furthermore, the gut microbe community was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing which identified Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes as the most abundant phyla. This study reveals the molecular basis for the adaptation of the oyster M. hongkongensis to environmental conditions."
